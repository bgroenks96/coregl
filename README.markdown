Simple utility classes and methods to make life with OpenGL core profile simpler.

The classes provided should be used pretty independently from each other. And the abstractions
provided are still rather low level. This is by intention since this library is supposed to be
as simple and lightweight as possible.

It is really only meant to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you would need to write when
talking to OpenGL core profile. It's not meant to be anything else.
