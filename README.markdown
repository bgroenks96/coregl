lwjgl-coregl-utils
==================

**Simple utility classes and methods to make life with OpenGL core profile simpler.**

- The classes provided can be used independently from each other. You don't need to learn a complex API.
- The abstractions provided are rather low level. This is by intention. The library is supposed to be as simple and lightweight as possible.

It is really only meant to reduce the amount of boilerplate code you would need to write when
talking to OpenGL core profile using LWJGL. **It's not meant to be anything else.**
